      Different Games Collective creates community resources and events to support marginalized voices in DIY and independent games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different Games Collective is a grassroots volunteer-run collaborative of a half-dozen core members, as well as an extended network of contributing members and a host of volunteer supporters. Known as the creators of <strong>the annual Brooklyn-based Different Games Conference</strong>, the collective has broadened our reach to include public programming in other US cities including smaller-scale game design workshops, lectures and more.

    <h2>Inclusivity statement</h2>
    <p>
      For three years, the Different Games Conference has addressed the need for creating safer spaces for games community members to share about our work and experiences. Our Inclusivity Statement, a living document we use to foster dialogue and facilitate accountability at our events, has been used as a template by a growing number of organizations interested in implementing safer space policies. <a href="/inclusivity-resources">View the current Inclusivity Statement</a>

      In each of its past years, Different Games has worked to foster diversity and inclusivity in games by amplifying the creative and critical voices of marginalized participants in games culture. Geared towards accessibility and radical inclusivity, our annual volunteer-led conference welcomes panels, workshops and playable games from presenters of all professional backgrounds and levels of expertise. Our programming is diverse and interdisciplinary with a focus on featuring emerging voices and representing identities and perspectives not typically supported by the commercial industry. <a href="http://2016.differentgames.org">View the 2016 Conference Site</a>
