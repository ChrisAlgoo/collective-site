bio: Hi, I am a current NYU Game Center MFA with a focus on game design. I have been a part of the Glorious Trainwrecks community for several years frequently creating various game jams on the website and hosting meet ups in my apartment. Currently, I am designing a 2 player bullet hell like fighting game based on a contemporary interpretation of Afrofuturism, Italian Futurist sculptures and paintings, free jazz, and Egyptian myth.
