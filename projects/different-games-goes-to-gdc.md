# Different Games Goes to GDC 2016

This year Different Games Collective is honored to have been chosen to take part in the 2016 GDC Scholars Program alongside some of our favorite community based organizations from around the world.

25 members of the Different Games community hope to attend GDC in San Francisco using the full passes gifted to us by GDCâ€™s generous scholarship program.

## Help us get there!

We'd love your sponsorship to help us cover the costs of traveling to San Francisco. <a href="/sponsorship">Learn more about sponsoring Different Games.</a>
