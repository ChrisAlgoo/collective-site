bio: Karina Popp is a Game Design MFA candidate at NYU. Her work in games criticism and design is driven by her desire to make all modes of engaging with games approachable for those who are geographically or economically unable to access education. Along with teaching elementary age students game design and development, Karina has written critically about and presented papers on games as calls for social reform and through the lens of queer theory. Her current research focuses on playing humorous parody games as an accessible way for players to analyze games.
