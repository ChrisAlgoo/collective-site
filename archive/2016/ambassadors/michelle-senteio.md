bio: Michelle studies Game Design at NYU Tisch and is immensely interested in the impact games have on players based on sociocultural and economic status. She is interested in designing digital games that are widely accessible and do not fit in the commercialized hardcore/casual gaming dichotomy. She has been exploring in her academic writing the notion of "gamer capital" and how many commercial gaming companies market to socioeconomically privileged demographics that have had access to the cultural capital of the video game world from an early age, and exclude other demographics that are equally enthusiastic about video games.
