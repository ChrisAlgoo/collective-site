## Collective

Different Games Collective is a grassroots volunteer-run collaborative of a half-dozen core members, as well as an extended network of contributing members and a host of volunteer supporters.
Known as the creators of the annual Brooklyn-based Different Games Conference, the collective has broadened our reach to include public programming in other US cities including smaller-scale game design workshops, lectures and more.

## Conferences

Different Games Conference is a Brooklyn-based event on diversity and inclusivity in games, which strives to amplify the creative and critical voices of marginalized participants in games culture.
Geared towards accessibility and radical inclusivity, our annual volunteer-led conference welcomes panels, workshops and playable games from presenters of all professional backgrounds and levels of expertise.
Our programming is diverse and interdisciplinary with a focus on featuring emerging voices and representing identities and perspectives not typically supported by the commercial industry.
