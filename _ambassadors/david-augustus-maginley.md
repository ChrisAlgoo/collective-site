bio: Howdy, I am chortletortle, an 18 year old nonbinary game designer pursuing NYU's Game Design BFA. For the past year, I have been all around NJ/NYC volunteering for different events, raising questions, and learning about representation in games. I have recently created a puzzle game about correcting pronouns called 'they' at GGJ 2016, but in the future, I'm interested in exploring games that feature gender identity, class, adolescence, intimacy, fat positivity/fatness, and mental health.
