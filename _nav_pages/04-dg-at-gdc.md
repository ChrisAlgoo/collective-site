## Announcing the Different Games GDC Ambassadors program!

This year our collective is honored to have been chosen to take part in the 2016 GDC Scholars program alongside some of our favorite community based organizations from around the world. 25 members of the collective and broader Different Games community have been offered the opportunity to represent the organization as Different Games Ambassadors to GDC, *but we need your help to get there.* As a volunteer-based organization, we’re looking to leaders in the tech and games industry to invest in our mission by becoming fiscal sponsors of the Different Games Ambassadors at GDG 2016.

Organizers and advocates from the Different Games community are working to raise the funds needed to attend GDC and take advantage of the full passes that have been generously gifted by GDC’s scholarship program. By partnering with us to bring Different Games Ambassadors to GDC 2016, you can help collective members and volunteers grow our knowledge and skills as well as broaden our reach within the professional games community. 

A donation of 1K would provide the funding needed to support travel and housing costs for one of our 2016 Different Games Ambassadors during the week of GDC. However, any amount will help us reach our goal of bringing Different Games mission of increasing diverse participation in games to one of the industry’s biggest stages. 

Join us in making the Different Games Ambassadors program a success this March and continuing to build a more vibrant, diverse and inclusive games community for us all.
