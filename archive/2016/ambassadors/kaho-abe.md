bio: Kaho Abe is a game designer and media artist who makes digital games with custom controllers that are played in the physical world. She shares her practice with local communities through education. Recently she has been exploring wearable gestural game controllers and immersive social virtual reality experiences while she is painfully aware that these are just buzzwords. But she is, really.
