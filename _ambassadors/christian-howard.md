bio: CHRISTIAN HOWARD is a writer, educator and game designer based in New York City. His work explores how we can better understand and prepare generations of non-dominant game designers to create games with purpose; to see their play and work as necessary acts with the potential to carve out new representational spaces for diversity in making and digital authorship. He is currently Narrative Design Lead and Dir. of Partnerships at Hidden Level Games, the studio that created Beta the Game, a digital platformer that teaches players the fundamentals of game design and code simultaneously.
