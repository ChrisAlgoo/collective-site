bio: Kristin is a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and a part-time independent game developer. Her research focuses on making human computation games more engaging for players and more effective at solving crowdsourcing problems. In addition to her research, a current project she is working on is a time-looping, Shakespearean adventure game called Elsinore, where the player explores the narrative of Hamlet through the lens of Ophelia.
