bio: Ramsey Nasser is a game designer and computer scientist researching programming tools in the hope to make coding a more inclusive and expressive craft for everyone. He is a strong believer that nothing he ever dreams up will ever be as interesting as two people interacting. As a result, his games tend to be spaces for people to have strange and surprising experiences with each other. He has made physical games in the past, and is currently exploring socially-minded VR games.
